1. Install Apache Ant
 
Go to the official Apache Ant site and download latest version, or any other if you don’t like to use newer versions. 
Download link:
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi


Create a new ANT directory (where ever you prefer) and unpack a downloaded archive. It should look something like this: D:\JavaScript\ANT\apache-ant-1.9.
 
Use this location and create a new environment variable called ANT_HOME, also use this variable and add it to your environment PATH like this: %ANT_HOME%\bin.
