= Communicating with the backend using $http service in Angularjs

:hp-image: http://jharaphula.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AngularJS_logo.png

Now days,every client-side JavaScript application needs to communicate with the backend.RESTful services are consumed using standard asynchronous HTTP requests, and the $http 
service provides all of the features that are required to bring the data into the application and write changes to the 
server.

The $http service is a function that takes a single argument: a configuration object that is used to
generate a HTTP request. The function returns a promise that has two helper methods: success and
error.
----
The most basic usage of the $http looks like:
$http({
method: 'GET',
url: '/api/users.json'
}).success(function(data, status, headers, config) {
  // This is called when the response is
  // ready
}).error(function(data, status, headers, config) {
  // This is called when the response
  // comes back with an error status
});
----


----
$http.get('http://rest-service.guides.spring.io/greeting').
        success(function(data) {
            $scope.greeting = data;
        });
}
----

If successful, it will assign the JSON returned back from the service to $scope.greeting.

*Complete list of Other methods:*

* $http.head
* $http.post
* $http.put
* $http.delete
* $http.jsonp
* $http.patch


=== Caching HTTP Requests
By default, the $http service does not cache requests in a local cache. We can enable caching per
request by passing either a boolean or a cache instance in our $http requests

----
$http.get('/api/cars.json', { cache: true })
.success(function(data) {})
.error(function(data) {});
----

The first time that we send this $http request, the $http service will send a GET request to
/api/carss.json. The next time that we send this GET request, instead of making the HTTP GET
request, it will pull the request out of the cache.
